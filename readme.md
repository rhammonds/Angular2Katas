# Angular 2 Katas

Small Angular 2 projects with one or a few distinct features.

All projects were generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.5.

All projects are generated to run on nodejs.

## Build

The node_modules folder was not uploaded so in order to build they need to be installed using npm install

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Other run options are npm start (same as npm run prod), ng serve, ng serve --e dev

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
